Hard rules for this repo:
- Implement ONLY the single chunk the user requests.
- After each chunk, STOP and output:
  1) Acceptance tests to run
  2) Exact terminal commands
  3) What success looks like
- Do NOT implement future chunks.
- Keep changes minimal and demo-first.
- Never put secrets in code. Read from .env.local only.
- All AI endpoints must be server-side (api routes). Never call OpenAI from the browser.
