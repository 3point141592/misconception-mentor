      "explanation": [
        "A fraction represents a part of a whole. The top number (numerator) tells you how many parts you have. The bottom number (denominator) tells you how many equal parts the whole is divided into.",
        "When adding or subtracting fractions, you need a **common denominator** first. This means both fractions must have the same bottom number. Once they do, you simply add or subtract the top numbers and keep the denominator the same."

          "Step 1: Find a common denominator. The denominators are 4 and 2. The smallest number that both divide into is 4.",
          "Step 2: Convert 1/2 to fourths: 1/2 = 2/4 (multiply top and bottom by 2).",
